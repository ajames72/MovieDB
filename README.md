## Documentation

### Prerequisites
You should have NodeJS installed on your machine in order to compile the javascript and run the tests.

Run _npm install_ from the project root to install the dependencies

### Webpack
The code is bundled into a single javascript file called bundle.js and deployed to the dist folder.

In order to compile the javascript bundle, run _webpack_ from the project root.

### Karma
The unit tests are run using [Karma-cli Test Runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/intro/installation.html).

To run the tests, run _karma start_ from the project root.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

_Please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Webpack. You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!_
